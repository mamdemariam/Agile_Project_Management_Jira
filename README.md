# Agile Project Management with Jira: A Planning Exercise

## Overview
This repository showcases a simulated Agile project management plan created in Jira. It demonstrates my ability to plan and manage a project using Agile methodologies. The project includes user stories, sprints, and sprint goals that highlight my understanding of basic project planning and sprint structuring.

## Project Details
### User Stories
The project contains the following user stories:

1. **User Story 1**: *As a user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my account.*
2. **User Story 2**: *As a user, I want to add, edit, and delete tasks so that I can manage my to-do list.*
3. **User Story 3**: *As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress.*
4. **User Story 4**: *As a user, I want to view a summary of completed tasks.*

### Sprint Planning
The project includes sprints with specific goals:

- **Sprint 1 Goal**: Implement features that allow for task management and progress tracking.
- **Sprint 2 Goal**: Develop features for viewing summaries of completed tasks and tracking user task progress.

## Project Setup and Process
### How I Planned the Project
1. **User Stories Creation**: The user stories were created to capture the key functionalities a user would expect in a task management system.
2. **Sprint Planning**: The stories were organized into sprints with specific goals to guide the development and showcase the Agile approach.

### What This Project Represents
- **Agile Methodology**: The project showcases my ability to plan and structure an Agile project.
- **User Story Management**: Demonstrates my understanding of defining user stories and sprint goals in Jira.
- **Planning Without Testing**: This project currently focuses on the planning phase without including test cases or a live testing component.

## Future Plans
I plan to expand this project to include:
- **Test Case Creation**: Adding test cases and showcasing how they are linked to user stories in Jira.
- **Bug Reporting**: Including bug tracking and management as part of the development process.
